## Project description

Trumponator is a tool for predicting stock market development based on the tweets of a famous comedian Donald Trump. 
We use advanced machine learning techniques like natural language processing to analyse the tweets and an artificial 
intelligence to predict how the stock markets will behave.

### Data

Tweets of Donald Trump, preprocessed by removing special characters, punctuation and case specific stopwords. We access 
the tweets by Twitter API.
 
Stock market information (timestamps, value) accessed through XXX -API


### Data analysis

We will build a supervised vector model with Fast Text -library, where the tweets will be labeled by effects on the stock 
market. The effects will be calculated from the changes in stock markets in a certain time frame after the tweets timestamp.

### Communication of results

We will document our project and findings, and make a visualization where we compare the real stock markets and the changes 
our model predicted. We will demonstrate the power (or the lack of it) of our model by applying the predictor to recent 
tweets of Trump.

### Operationalization

TIf the results match the real stock markets, there is a tool for traders to make short term investments. Our predictor 
will show if there is clear correlation between the tweets of Trump and the stock market. This correlation is now suspected 
and speculated by many, so it is interesting to do research on the matter.
